**NOTICE**: This repository is obsolete. The content is now
maintained under the
[dwave-ocean-sdk](https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk)

Updating content
===============================
First, fork this repo in GitHub, clone it on your workstation, and make pull requests from commits you push to your forked repo.

Contributing this way requires some set-up, but once this is done, you can contribute frequently from your own GitHub repo.

Our docs have the following dependencies:
- Sphinx version 1.6.2
- Python version 2.7 or 3

After making your changes but before submitting a PR, run the shell command `make html` at the root of your local
repo to check for errors and build a local version of the doc set in HTML for testing. Before running make for
the first time, install Sphinx, the documentation generator, possibly using sudo:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: The default target directory is **docs**. This is the target that creates the appropriate build directory on
your local machine and references in the source files of your local repo.

The docs build in a minute or two. To view the local version you built, either:
- Open the _build/<filename> file in your browser.
- Use a local web server like the SimpleHTTPServer Python module.

Viewing your content using the SimpleHTTPServer module allows you to navigate through the documentation
as if you were browsing it online. To use the SimpleHTTPServer module:

1. Navigate to the build directory.
2. Run python -m SimpleHTTPServer. After the server starts up, connect to your docs through your loopback IP address (http://127.0.0.1:8000).
